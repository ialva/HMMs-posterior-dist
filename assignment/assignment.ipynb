Instead of the single function `_build_matrix` from Viterbi, you will have two: `_build_forward_matrix` and `_build_backward_matrix`. You will then combine them inside `_posterior_probabilities`. `posterior_decode` calls `_posterior_probabilities` and uses the result to find the posterior path and output the corresponding state names."

You should also normalize the product of the two, so that at the end of the calculation you have the posterior probabilities of the states for each observation."
